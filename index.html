            <h2>First Experience with Volleyball</h2>
            <p>I began playing Volleyball around January of 2020. This experience was rather cultivating and new for me. When I heard that Stuyvesant had a volleyball team, I was determined to join. Throughout arduous training, I was finally able to join the team and play volleyball for Stuyvesant! Though the season was cut short, we were still able to bond as teammates. I really do hope that in the future I will be able to play with the Stuyvesant Beasts again! (P.S The position that I decided to play was Setter)

            <h2>Summer Volleyball Experience</h2>
            <p>The summer of 2020 was tough: I decided that sitting at home the entire day was not good for my mental health. Because of this, a lot of my other friends decided to play volleyball together and even host our own tournaments. We all bought our own nets and set up in the park to play.

            <h2>Playing in Higher Leagues</h2>
            <p>
            After the summer has passed, I decided that in order to improve my skill and practice more volleyball it would be better if I joined a club team. So, in October, my friend David and I were able to join our current volleyball club, called NYC Volleyball Academy. By doing so, we both improved so much from the point that we have started. Now, our next challenge is being able to travel to tournaments out-of-state and crush all of the competition that comes ahead of us!
